You don't have to go through this alone. Would you like me to help you think through some immediate safety steps?",
    "What you're feeling right now is incredibly painful, and I want you to know that reaching out shows tremendous strength. Please contact emergency services at 112 or Tele-MANAS at 14416 right away. Your life has value and meaning. Can we talk about what immediate support you have available?",

  depression: [

  stress: [

  ],
  
  // Coping and resilience building
  coping: [
    "It sounds like you're looking for ways to cope with what you're experiencing. That's a positive step. What coping strategies have you tried before, and how did they work for you?",
    "Building coping skills is an ongoing process, and it's different for everyone. Some people find breathing exercises helpful, others prefer physical activity or creative expression. What tends to bring you a sense of calm or relief?",
    "I'm glad you're thinking about healthy ways to manage these feelings. Self-care isn't selfish - it's necessary. What activities or practices usually help you feel more centered?",
